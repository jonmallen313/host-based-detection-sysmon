Day 2 Write-up:
EventID: 1
Timestamp: 4/23/2025 9:15:33 AM
Process name: powershell.exe
CommandLine: Start-Process calc.exe

Assessment: True Positive - Execution of calc.exe via PowerShell
Context: This event logs the execution of the Calculator application (calc.exe) through PowerShell, simulating a benign program execution as part of the attack chain.

EventID: 1
Timestamp: 4/23/2025 9:16:02 AM
Process name: powershell.exe
CommandLine: Start-Process notepad.exe

Assessment: True Positive - Execution of notepad.exe via PowerShell
Context: This event logs the execution of the Notepad application (notepad.exe) through PowerShell, simulating another benign program execution in the attack chain.

EventID: 13
Timestamp: 4/23/2025 9:17:12 AM
Process name: powershell.exe
RegistryKey: HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\MaliciousApp

Assessment: True Positive - Registry modification for persistence
Context: A registry key was created to ensure the malicious application runs automatically when the user logs in. Sysmon detected this registry modification, highlighting a persistence mechanism.

EventID: 7
Timestamp: 4/23/2025 9:18:05 AM
Process name: schtasks.exe
Technique_ID: T1053 / Scheduled Task
Image Loaded: C:\Windows\System32\taskschd.dll

Assessment: True Positive - Scheduled task creation detected
Context: Sysmon detected the execution of schtasks.exe used to create a scheduled task that would execute a malicious executable at a specified time. This event is part of the attacker’s persistence mechanism.

EventID: 17
Timestamp: 4/23/2025 9:19:25 AM
Process name: powershell.exe
TargetFilename: C:\Windows\System32\Tasks\MaliciousTask.exe

Assessment: True Positive - Malicious task file creation
Context: A malicious task file (MaliciousTask.exe) was created in the Task Scheduler directory. Sysmon logged this event as part of the attacker’s persistence strategy.

EventID: 18
Timestamp: 4/23/2025 9:20:14 AM
Process name: schtasks.exe
TargetFilename: C:\Windows\System32\Tasks\MaliciousTask.exe
CommandLine: schtasks.exe /create /tn MaliciousTask /tr C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Temp\malicious.exe /sc once /st 09:20

Assessment: True Positive - Task execution command to trigger malicious executable
Context: Sysmon detected the execution of schtasks.exe used to schedule the malicious executable (malicious.exe) to run at a specific time. This is an example of persistence and execution through scheduled tasks.

EventID: 26
Timestamp: 4/23/2025 9:21:50 AM
Process name: powershell.exe
TargetFilename: C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Temp\malicious.exe

Assessment: True Positive - Deletion of malicious file
Context: The malicious file dropped in the Temp directory (malicious.exe) was deleted as part of the cleanup phase. Sysmon detected the file deletion event, simulating an attacker removing traces of their presence after completing the attack.

Assessment: True Positive - Malicious task execution via scheduled task
Context: The malicious task executed at the specified time, and Sysmon logged the event as a process creation for svchost.exe, which launched the malicious task. This is a critical event in tracking the success of the attacker’s persistence mechanism.
