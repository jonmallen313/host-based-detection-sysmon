Day 2 Write-up:
EventID: 1
Timestamp: 4/23/2025 9:15:33 AM
Process name: powershell.exe
CommandLine: Start-Process calc.exe

Assessment: True Positive - Execution of calc.exe via PowerShell
Context: The execution of calc.exe via PowerShell is logged by Sysmon as a standard process creation event. 
This is part of the simulated attack chain to test detection of command execution in a host-based detection scenario.

EventID: 1
Timestamp: 4/23/2025 9:16:02 AM
Process name: powershell.exe
CommandLine: Start-Process notepad.exe

Assessment: True Positive - Execution of notepad.exe via PowerShell
Context: Similar to the previous event, launching notepad.exe via PowerShell is part of the simulated attack to 
validate detection capabilities of Sysmon on executable launches through PowerShell scripts.

EventID: 10
Timestamp: 4/23/2025 9:17:12 AM
Process name: powershell.exe
TargetFilename: C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Temp\malicious.exe

Assessment: True Positive - Simulated persistence via file creation
Context: A malicious executable was created in the Temp directory, simulating an attacker establishing persistence. 
Sysmon logs this as a file creation event, which is crucial for detecting malicious file drops.

EventID: 10
Timestamp: 4/23/2025 9:17:28 AM
Process name: powershell.exe
TargetFilename: C:\Windows\System32\Tasks\MaliciousTask.exe

Assessment: True Positive - Persistence mechanism via task creation
Context: A malicious executable was placed in the Scheduled Tasks folder, emulating the creation of a persistence mechanism. 
Sysmon logs this file creation event, which can be used for later task execution detection.

EventID: 13
Timestamp: 4/23/2025 9:18:07 AM
Process name: powershell.exe
RegistryKey: HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\MaliciousApp

Assessment: True Positive - Registry modification for persistence
Context: A registry entry was created under the Run key to ensure the malicious application runs on every user login. 
Sysmon detected this registry modification, crucial for detecting persistence via registry keys.

EventID: 1
Timestamp: 4/23/2025 9:19:12 AM
Process name: powershell.exe
CommandLine: "C:\Windows\System32\schtasks.exe" /create /tn MaliciousTask /tr C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Temp\malicious.exe /sc once /st 09:20

Assessment: True Positive - Scheduled task creation for malicious executable
Context: This event logs the creation of a scheduled task that runs the malicious executable created earlier. 
Sysmon logs this as a process creation event associated with a scheduled task creation, highlighting the attacker’s method of ensuring the persistence of their malicious executable.

EventID: 7
Timestamp: 4/23/2025 9:19:24 AM
Process name: schtasks.exe
Technique_ID: T1053 / Scheduled Task
Image Loaded: C:\Windows\System32\taskschd.dll

Assessment: True Positive - Scheduled task creation detected
Context: The execution of the schtasks.exe command to create a scheduled task was detected by Sysmon. 
This event is significant for detecting the use of scheduled tasks to maintain persistence or execute malicious code at a specified time.

EventID: 10
Timestamp: 4/23/2025 9:20:14 AM
Process name: svchost.exe
TargetFilename: C:\Windows\System32\Tasks\MaliciousTask.exe

Assessment: True Positive - Malicious task execution via scheduled task
Context: The malicious task executed at the specified time, and Sysmon logged the event as a process creation for svchost.exe, which launched the malicious task. This is a critical event in tracking the success of the attacker’s persistence mechanism.
